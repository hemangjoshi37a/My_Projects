- Internet connected language model for formatted(json) data extraction.
- ESP32 Camera case. and connect to wordpress website.
- Robot dog based auto inventory/stock handling, databasing and e-commerce content creation.
- AI Educational chatbot using custom trained BLOOM model subject-wise.
- Solar Boat/RV/Motor-home.
- Chip manufacturing.
- Telegram message based auto backtesting against old stockmarket data using custom BLOOM model.
- Photogrametry web API for creating 3D plans for real estate brokers.
- Solar peliter water desalination module.
- Pani-puri vending machine with UPI payment method and telegram bot and automatic water dispensing system.
- RGB Led matrix cube for advertisement and show piece for restaurants and hotels with live photogrametry to 3d visulization with clear epoxy as filler.
- Road-side-ways/High-rise-building advertisement led matrix display with web api or telegram bot for auto upload for video and photo with auto qr UPI based payments and auto ad price decide using user loading.
- Auto Clothes AI : Determine client body shape and size using webcam and 3d photogrametry. -> Clothers laser cutter and stitcher for best fit clothes.
- Auto manufacturing : 3d scanned point cloud -> Object/Geometry recognition and material recognition -> Language model for NC code generator -> Auto material and manufacturing cost calculation -> Manufacturing and delivering job to client. Take order online through e-commerece website or chat bot (WhatsApp/Telegram).
- Auto material handling bot : 3d point cloud scanner -> object.rec. with boundry in 3d space. and databasing location.-> Determine best place to grab for most optimised motor operations. -> picking with robotic hand. -> path planning to reach destination. -> placing object to destination.
- Auto labelled ML training data generator for 3d vision. : scan 3d point cloud. -> convert to geometry/object. -> take random position photographs of generated geometry/object with location/mask and point cloud data with random background and random rotated positions. -> save the data to proper format (i.e. photos to PNG, location/mask data to csv).
- https://plainsight.ai/ ripoff. : initially wait for first image annotation.(auto boundary from square to fit) -> determine best model size and structure for given image size. -> Train model continuesly using first annotation. and predict rest samples in parrellel. (while saperating already human annotated dataset and model predicted dataset.) -> Show next image with predicted annotation and ask for changes from client/person. person edits annotation and clicks on save&next as the sample is moved from predicted to human annotated dataset. -> process continues untill all samples are done. -> provide provisional model and annotations.
- Backup raspberry pi server for all laptop and other data backup using ssd.
- Android LiFi communication using Phone camera and LED light in phone.
- Interesting beacon project : Find near range people that are interested in same topics as you. From you profile grabbed from facebook linkedin or whatever mathches other people's profile and also financial details from the posts. it uses audio pulses to send and receive data for near field communication. Sends pulses every 5 seconds interval, or at smaller interval when moving and after long time if standing or sitting. Also target find diretly people using your current activity.
- Chrome browser extention for automatically removing watermarks and superresolution on stock paid images using stable diffusion. Having initial free 5000 free image and paid after free quota complete. In extention setting one can turn on and off superresolution and watermark removal.
- Test performance of genetics algoriths on algotrading.
- Adversarial attacks on chatbots in websites to gain authentication for admin access.
