- Road-side-ways/High-rise-building advertisement led matrix display with web api or telegram bot for auto upload for video and photo with auto qr UPI based payments and auto ad price decide using user loading.
- Auto Clothes AI : Determine client body shape and size using webcam and 3d photogrametry. -> Clothers laser cutter and stitcher for best fit clothes.
- Auto manufacturing : 3d scanned point cloud -> Object/Geometry recognition and material recognition -> Language model for NC code generator -> Auto material and manufacturing cost calculation -> Manufacturing and delivering job to client. Take order online through e-commerece website or chat bot (WhatsApp/Telegram).
- Auto material handling bot : 3d point cloud scanner -> object.rec. with boundry in 3d space. and databasing location.-> Determine best place to grab for most optimised motor operations. -> picking with robotic hand. -> path planning to reach destination. -> placing object to destination.
- Auto labelled ML training data generator for 3d vision. : scan 3d point cloud. -> convert to geometry/object. -> take random position photographs of generated geometry/object with location/mask and point cloud data with random background and random rotated positions. -> save the data to proper format (i.e. photos to PNG, location/mask data to csv).
- ~https://plainsight.ai/ ripoff. : initially wait for first image annotation.(auto boundary from square to fit) -> determine best model size and structure for given image size. -> Train model continuesly using first annotation. and predict rest samples in parrellel. (while saperating already human annotated dataset and model predicted dataset.) -> Show next image with predicted annotation and ask for changes from client/person. person edits annotation and clicks on save&next as the sample is moved from predicted to human annotated dataset. -> process continues untill all samples are done. -> provide provisional model and annotations.~ This concept is very well followed well by [label-studio](https://labelstud.io/) and is open source.
- Backup raspberry pi server for all laptop and other data backup using ssd.
- Android LiFi communication using Phone camera and LED light in phone.
- Interesting beacon project : Find near range people that are interested in same topics as you. From you profile grabbed from facebook linkedin or whatever mathches other people's profile and also financial details from the posts. it uses audio pulses to send and receive data for near field communication. Sends pulses every 5 seconds interval, or at smaller interval when moving and after long time if standing or sitting. Also target find diretly people using your current activity.
- Chrome browser extention for automatically removing watermarks and superresolution on stock paid images using stable diffusion. Having initial free 5000 free image and paid after free quota complete. In extention setting one can turn on and off superresolution and watermark removal.
- Test performance of genetics algoriths on algotrading.
- Adversarial attacks on AI/ML chatbots in websites to gain authentication for admin access.
- Fridge cam for monitoring fridge items using machine learning what is available in the fridge using multiple camera and syncing items list in the cloud and personal app. Also contains touch display outside the fridge that can be magnetically stuck and interactively change camera views and list of items containing. Also auto slideshow for all these given screens.
- A job platform where you pay in the form of time instead of money(or any type of physical(gold/silver/..),fiat(INR/UDS/GBP/..) or virtual currency(BTC/ETH/..)). Where time is the currency. How it works? There are two parties in a trade 1) Person buying goods/services pays the seller his time, in other words the buyer has to either has to work for certain hours for seller if he wants something from seller or he can pay other people's time that is in his wallet that has similar or higher PersonQuality-rating than him(buyer).Everything (all the transactions records) are maintained in a crypto bockchain, also the TAC(Time As Currency) wallet. For example if you want to buy groceries in a store you have to work for the defined time in that store or have to arrange someone that can work for that much time and has PersonQuality-rating same as you or better than yours. What is PersonQuality-rating? : It is rating given to buyer and seller to one-another and revealed only after both of them submit their ratings. 
- NLP model to generate code to do anything and everything. Here is a well designed prompt : *** Here a machine learning model helps a human to complete a task, by generating a python code that can be used to complete the task, by subdividing the given task to a tree of subtasks untill the leafs of the tree are the description from which a code can be generated to complete the task of the leaf.***
Task given by human : Please help me place a online order to buy a owen.
Answer by the machine learning model model : 1. Place a order on e-commerce website. 1.1 find a e-commerce website where ovens are available to be sold at the budget price. 1.2 goto that e-commerce website. 1.3 search for over.
